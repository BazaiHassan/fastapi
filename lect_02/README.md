## Order of Route Functions in FastAPI
In FastAPI (and many web frameworks), the order in which you define your routes matters because the router matches routes sequentially from top to bottom. This is particularly important when you have overlapping routes (like a fixed path vs. a path with a parameter).

Key Rule:
Fixed paths (static routes) should be defined before dynamic (parameterized) paths.
If you define `/product/{id}` before `/product/latest`, FastAPI will treat "latest" as an `{id}` parameter, which is usually not what you want.
